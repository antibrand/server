## About

This server is a portable, isolated, fast & powerful universal development environment for PHP, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby. It is fast, lightweight, easy-to-use and easy-to-extend.

This server is great for building and managing modern web applications. It is focused on performance  - designed around stability, simplicity, flexibility and freedom.

This server is very lightweight and will stay as lean as possible. The core binary itself is less than 2MB and uses less than 4MB RAM when running.

This server doesn't use Windows services. It has its own `service orchestration` which manages services asynchronously and non-blocking so you'll find things run fast & smoothly with server.

Enjoy!
